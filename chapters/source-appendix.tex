\chapter{Reference for \slang}
\label{sec:source:appendix}
This appendix contains the complete definitions of the semantics of \slang, in
particular, its type system and evaluation semantics.
All \slang figures from \fullref[]{chp:source} are reproduced and completed with
elided parts here, and elided figures are presented here.

Note that the observations depend on the particular pair languages and translation;
Here, I give only \slang observations.
In each target language, I will define the target language observation, and each
translation gives the cross-language relation for observations.
